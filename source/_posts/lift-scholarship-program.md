After graduating from campus 10 years ago, I didn't expect that I would still be eligible for a scholarship, especially considering that I wasn't a high-achieving student at that time. But recently, I joined one program from Linux Foundation: [`The Shubhra Kar Linux Foundation Training (LiFT) Scholarship Program`](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/lift-scholarships). And very luckily, get awarded.

I plan and hope to set up a bright new career in the open-source software field, that's the motivation to join the program! 

Thanks to the award from Linux Foundation, I got the opportunity to select one training course and certification exam freely. Big thanks. 

And the one I choose is [`CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)`](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/), stay tuned, I will update the status later.
