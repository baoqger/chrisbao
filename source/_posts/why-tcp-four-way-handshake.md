### Background

In `TCP/IP` protocol stack, the `three way handshake` for connection establishment and `four way handshake` for connection termination are some concepts you must understand.

But after I learned these knowledge, the question coming to my mind is why the connection termination need four-way handshake. In this article, I will focus on this topic. To understand the answer for this question, we need to first explain the details of these two processes and compare them to find the the difference.
