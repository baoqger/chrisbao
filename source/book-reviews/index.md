*You can't create something out of nothing.*

**Docker Deep Dive**

When I want to learn how Docker works behind the scenes, I searched a lot online, but the output is very limited. And 'Docker Deep Dive' is the only one I can find! This book covers many topics related to Docker. It doesn't show the source code level details, but it serves as a good starting point for the exploration of the container technology world. The explanation of [`VXLAN`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN) in the Docker networking part is the most impressive chapter for me.
