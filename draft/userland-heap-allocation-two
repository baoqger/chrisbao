Process Memory Layout.
Basic virtual memory introduction.
Detailed Memory layout => source of various sections <== memory allocation at compile time(static allocation of memory) and runtime time(dynamic allocation of memory). => ELF file => loader
*Consider multiple threads layout
Userland memory allocation ==> Key
    allocation memory in user space



analysis based on malloc
    various data structures: bins and chunks
    通过例子反推实现点
        alignment
        P bit
        big/little endian
        gdb command
        bins => 忽略细节 linked list to store freed chunks for reusing
        bins的内容 => linked list 支持不连续内存单元
        展示top section的变化 ==> 从零开始
        展示 bins的变化 ==> free and reuse
